# Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-for-Sentiment-Analysis
A sentiment analysis project using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify student feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Built and trained in Google Colab.


## Project Overview

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stop words, etc.)
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
- Training a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation using accuracy and F1 score

## Contents
- `Multinomial Naive Bayes.ipynb`: The main notebook for training and evaluating the model
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
- `mnb_model.pkl/`: Trained model

## Setup Instructions
On Google Colab:
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thegreatkeljb/Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-for-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) or download the notebook and upload it to Google Colab.
2. Run all

Locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run all

## Results
- Accuracy: 92.86%
- F1 Score: 0.9285
